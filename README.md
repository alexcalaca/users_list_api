Technical Test

User List
In this task, we kindly request you to develop a program using the Ruby on Rails framework to
consume the API "https://run.mocky.io/v3/ce47ee53-6531-4821-a6f6-71a188eaaee0" and display
user data in a paginated table. The objective is to assess your ability to set up Ruby on Rails, work with APIs, and implement a user interface with pagination.

Requirements:
- Ruby on Rails Configuration:
- Install Ruby on Rails in your development environment.
- Configure the environment to properly run Ruby on Rails.

API Consumption:
- Utilize Ruby on Rails functionalities to make HTTP requests to the API.

Paginated User Table:
- Create a route in Ruby on Rails to access the user page.
- Develop a controller that consumes the API "https://run.mocky.io/v3/ce47ee53-6531-4821-a6f6-71a188eaaee0", retrieves user data, and
implements pagination logic.
- Create a view that displays user data in a paginated table.
- Style the table and page using CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap).

Technical Implementation:
- Use Ruby on Rails to configure the development environment and create routes, controllers, and
views.
- Use Ruby on Rails functionalities to make HTTP requests to the API
"https://run.mocky.io/v3/ce47ee53-6531-4821-a6f6-71a188eaaee0".
- Implement pagination logic to display user data in groups (10 users per page).
- Use CSS or a CSS framework to style the user table and page.

Additional Notes:
- Make sure to follow Ruby on Rails best practices regarding project structure, code
organization, and library usage.
- Document any limitations or assumptions you encounter during development.
- Store your code in a public github repository

Conclusion:
We expect you to complete this task by developing a program using Ruby on Rails to consume the
API "https://run.mocky.io/v3/ce47ee53-6531-4821-a6f6-71a188eaaee0" and display user data in a
paginated table. This will allow us to assess your ability to configure Ruby on Rails, consume APIs, and create user interfaces. Good luck!
